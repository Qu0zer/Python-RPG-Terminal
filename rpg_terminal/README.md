# INTRODUCTION

This is my first big python project üêç! I'm making a mini python-rpg-terminal from the very start so I can improve my skills and I'll upgrade as much as I consider.

The story and characters of this terminal rpg are taken from Fire Emblem The Blazing Blade (2003), so any related to character and story making are not of my own. **Please have that in consideration.** What I'm trying to achieve it's to recreate the JRPG typical system of Fire Emblem into a turn-combat system.

# ABOUT

You, the player, are a traveller who has studied the arts of war. Your dream is to be a great tactician. One day you wake up and find a young girl called Lyn, a nomad of the Sacae Plains, together you embark in a journey to get stronger. On your journey you meet a strange pair who informs that her maternal grandfather, Lord Hausen of Caelin, has invited her to meet him in his home. On the way to Caelin, you learn that Lyn's grandfather is being poisoned by her granduncle, who desires to succeed his brother by underhand means.

Help Lyn in her quest to retake Caelin from the power hungry Lundgren!
